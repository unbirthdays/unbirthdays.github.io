              <span id="intro">I'm Sabrina Baccam! Pronouns are she/her/hers. Living in Austin, TX. ⤜(ⱺ ʖ̯ⱺ)⤏<br>
                Thanks for coming around here to learn more about me in the 5-9. Outside of work or any educational program I'm in, you can usually find me with my pets (Chiweenie dog named Momo and lynx-point Siamese cat named Appa) at home,
                going to the local movie theater or out to eat at a new restaurant, making a matcha or cappuccino, doing yoga, engaging in my numerous hobbies, learning how to do gel-x nails,
                or traveling to one of the 50 states in America that I haven't gone to yet.<br>
                If you meet me in the wild, you'll learn that I'm a very normal person that makes the most out of work-life balance. Although I work hard to either reach my goals or learn something new as often as possible,
                I make sure to put my family and home first.<br>Feel free to check out this page to learn about a tiny fraction of my personality.</span>

                <p>My best friend, child, and dog. Her name is Momo! She is a mix of Dachschund, Chihuahua, Bulldog, Pitbull, and a bunch of other random dog breeds. She was adopted as a runt of a litter and ended up being smaller than both of her parents.
                She has such an emotional intelligence; you just HAVE to meet her. Here is she eating a watermelon.

            <div class="slide">
                <img class="img-party" height="300vh" src="/public/images/appa.png"/>
                <p>This is my boy Appa. He was a rescue from a cat shelter in my hometown of Houston, TX. Ever since he's been with me, he's been either completely solitary or attached to my hip. No in-between.
                    <br>He has some odd quirks such as really liking dried foods (jerky, pork floss, dried squid) and holding his back leg when he sits down.
                </p>

                <p>One of my hobbies is building mechanical keyboards. This is my current keyboard, the Kohaku by Singa.  I typically use 65% keyboards.</p>

                <img class="img-party" height="300vh" src="/public/images/matcha.jpg" /><br><br>
                <p>I also really enjoy matcha and coffee. I typically try different ceremonial graded matchas or utilize my espresso machine. I try to attend the coffee festival every year in my city, but I've noticed that caffeine without L-theanine gets me jittery and anxious, so I've been having my cappuccinos sparingly.</p>

                <img class="img-party" height="300vh" src="/public/images/conservatory.png" /><br><br>
                <p>This part is a little embarrassing, but I have a semi-unhealthy obsession with plants. I enjoy collecting houseplants, constructing terrariums, and aquascaping. Every week, I take about an hour to water all the plants in my house while listening to my favorite tunes.</p>

                <img class="img-party" height="300vh" src="/public/images/wes.png" /><br><br>
                <p>I love going to the movies very often. If I'm not at home or the office, I'm probably at my closest AMC. My favorite film is The Sound of Music, but I have a big spot in my heart for Minari; Everything, Everywhere, All at Once; 12 Angry Men; It Comes at Night; Interstellar; The Martian; etc.
                    The photo above is when I was filmed for a Wes Anderson short.</p>
