        <span id="intro"><br>Hi. I'm Sabrina. I'm a budding software engineer that has an interest in data science.
            My studies involve Python, SQL, data cleansing, data interpretation, data modeling, data visualization,
            and a bunch of other things where I take data and make sense of it. I also learned some web development 
            to make random websites like this one.</span><br><br><br>

        <h1 id="name">Sabrina Baccam</h1>
        <h4 id="pronouns">(she/her/hers)</h4>
        <p id="aboutme">Sabrina is a lifelong learner dedicated to spending the seconds of her minutes of her hours to creating something.
            Anything. She is an alumna from the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. She minored
            in French, but don't test her on it. She can read much better than she can speak.<br>
            As a first-generation American, she survived most of that time working odd jobs to find the means to 
            support herself through her studies. She eventually jumped into the technical recruiting world by chance before moving on to work
            for a few software engineering boot camps. Sponsored by her employer, she enrolled in the programs to learn the world of data analytics,
            something that she dabbled in during her economics studies.<br><br>
            Currently, she is upskilling within her tech stack. In her free time, she likes to garden, build and mod keyboards, and watch horror movies
            when she's home alone. She lives with her partner (Senior Software Engineer and tutor) Henry, her dog Momo, her cat
            Appa, her stupidly large collection of plants, her multiple betta fish, and her cherry shrimp colony.
